Was made with HackerRank online IDE
program name: Count Luck

this countLuck function takes a maze in the form of an array of strings.
in the array of strings, there can be:
X:Wall
.:Pathway
M:Start
*:finish

it also takes an integer k that is a guess on how many times someone has to make a decision on where to turn.

if the guess is correct, return "impressive"
else return "oops!"

It also prints the minimum amount of choices it will have to make while finding its way to the finish.
